## 09 Feb 2018 - Ver 1.4.0
 - Fix issue with muti-level template inheritance! Sections needed to be updated instead of
   the templateString for mid-level compile steps.
 - Added a new directive: @require('some/file/name') and made @include('another/file) optional.
   i.e. @include won't throw an error if the file doesn't exist, but @require will.

## 13 Feb 2018 - Ver 1.4.1
 - Fix issue with overriding section content over multiple levels. (More like completing unfinished features,
    since I noted that it doesn't work way back when! The same goes for the multi-level update above. )
 - Fix issue with not following @parent directives all the way to the top-most level.

## 25 May 2018 - Ver 1.5.0
 - Change "@section .. @show" directive to "@yieldDefault .. @show and make the feature work correctly!
 - Added Template::leftFlushContent() to ensure DEFAULT yield content AND section content
   always align correctly.
 - Improve Template::compileYield() to properly detect and handle the top-most template level.
